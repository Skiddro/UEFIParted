## UEFIParted - A similar, yet better live distro of GParted's live distro.

# What is UEFIParted?
UEFIParted is similar to GParted's live distro, but more updated and works on UEFI-systems. It is debian-based, and is made from scratch.

# What comes with UEFIParted?
- GParted.
- Nearly all filesystem-support packages.
- Firefox ESR.
- BalenaEtcher.
- WoeUSB-NG.
- NetworkManager. (Connect to WiFi via "nmtui".)
- And possibly more than what I can remember such as the "hwinfo" command.

# Why was this made?
I made UEFIParted because GParted's live distro looked and seemed old and very outdated from the last time I checked, and it did not boot on UEFI-systems. UEFIParted aims to be like their live distro, but more updated and with extra features including being bootable on both UEFI and Legacy systems.
